So that I can keep track of my music listening
I want to add tracks I've listened to and see a list of them.

Class Musiclistened 

def initialise 
   # to initialise 
end 

def add(tracks)
   # add tracks to list 
end 

def returning 
   # returns the list after adding track 
end

musiclistened = Musiclistened.new 
musiclistened = []

musiclistened = Musiclistened. new 
musiclistened.add("Billy jean")
musiclistened.list ["Billy jean"]

musiclistened - musiclistend.new 
musiclistened.add("Billy Jean")
musiclistened.add("Beat it")
musiclistened.list ["Billy jean", "Beat it"]
